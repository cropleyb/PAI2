How to unit test pai2?

Components
----------
AlphaBeta - Mock out Bridge as template

Move Suggestor
Utility Calculator
Utility Stats
Game State
ABBridge? Or is this the Game/Game State?

board locations: (these are shared with move suggestor)
total counts/length for each player
  "      "  /caps    "    "    "
  "      "  /threats "    "    "

other measurements:
caps for each player (should also be used by move suggestor)
  "      "  /enc. 4s "    "    "
chessboard counts

Index + BoardStrip -> Loc
start of strip + direction * index
can this be done with ints? probably :)

who calls who?
Game::make move
    setOcc
		before - iterate over masks for board strip
			length lookup table access
			convert indices to Locs
			update move suggestor/utility data
		update board strip data (place/capture 1 piece)
		after - iterate over masks for board strip
			length lookup table access
			convert indices to Locs
			update move suggestor/utility data

BoardLine
 - max index
 - min index?
 - Left edge start Loc?
/LengthLookupTable
BoardDirectionRep (=old DirectionStrips)
 - array of BoardLines
 - bit representation of whole board
 - direction (Loc offset)
 - convert from ind to Loc and back
 - beforeSetOcc(loc, colour, posStats)
 - afterSetOcc(loc, colour, posStats)
 - Uses lengthLookupTable
BoardReps
 - 4x BoardDirectionReps
 - setOcc(loc, colour, posStats)
Game
 - BoardRep
/PriorityLevel
 - Priority levels must be searched in order of decreasing counts per candidate
 - Sort on demand. Quicksort variant? Natural Merge sort?
 - Dirty bit
PositionStats
 /- PriorityLevel * 4 for line lengths
 /- PriorityLevel * 2 for takes and threats
 /- Captured counts
 - Chessboard counts
/CandidateCache
 /- max depth * max breadth array of Locs
 /- max depth * number of Locs
 /- max depth * next Loc index
- MoveSuggestor = old PriorityFilter
/AlphaBeta
 /- first cut
